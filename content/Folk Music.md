## Folk Music

### A Personal Passion

While industrial piping engineering is my profession, folk music serves as a creative outlet that helps me process the complexities of life and work. Through simple arrangements and straightforward lyrics, I document observations about everyday experiences.

### Performance Schedule

I occasionally perform at local venues in Luxembourg, typically on weekends when not involved in industrial projects. These acoustic sessions provide an opportunity to share technical insights through a different medium.

### Recording Philosophy

My recordings are intentionally minimal, usually consisting of just acoustic guitar and vocals. This approach mirrors my belief in efficient system design - using only what's necessary to achieve the desired outcome.

### Notes on Process

Just as in piping engineering, my songwriting follows a structured approach:
- Identify the core concept
- Develop the fundamental framework
- Add necessary components
- Test and refine
- Document the results

The main difference is that in music, emotional resonance takes precedence over technical specifications.
